# Project Title 

Healthcare Analysis

## Summary

The scope of our project is to analyze and find if there are correlation between quality of healthcare 
(using MIPS and Hospital Rating by Medicare as basis of comparison) and various parameters (Gender, Experience, Medical School attended).

# Getting Started

## Check your conda version

* Open your console or git bash console.
* Type `conda -V` (note that the `V` is capitalized)
  * The return output should state conda with a version number
    * Something like `4.3.27`, but the version number may differ some
  * If you don't get this return output, you need to [reinstall anaconda on your computer][1]
* Familiarize yourself with the [conda cheatsheet][2] for all of your conda needs

### Prerequisites

Before you continue, ensure you have met the following requirements:

* You have installed the latest version of Python.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
